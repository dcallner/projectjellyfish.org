Project Jellyfish is an IT broker system. It allows administrators to create a product catalog of any type of service (IaaS, TaaS, PaaS, or even Staff) and allows them to be assigned a cost, and then users can create projects and add those services to a project. Jellyfish current supports IaaS via ManageIQ and Chef.  Project Jellyfish has 3 main components: Jellyfish-API, Jellyfish-UX, and ManageIQ.
